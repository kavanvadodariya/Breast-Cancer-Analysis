# Breast-Cancer-Analysis

 This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer patient data through robust preprocessing techniques and visual insights. After cleaning and preparing the dataset, an interactive Power BI dashboard has been       developed to present meaningful trends, patterns, and indicators that support early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

=> Key Features:

    1) Data Preprocessing
    2) Handling missing values
    3)Removing duplicates
    4)Standardization & encoding
    5)Feature selection for improved clarity

=> Interactive Power BI Dashboard:

    1)Visual exploration of benign vs malignant cases
    2)Highlighting key clinical attributes
    3)Trend analysis & relationship insights
    4)User-friendly navigation and filters

=> Objective:

    - To support data-driven understanding of breast cancer indicators
    - To present the dataset in a simple, visually interpretable format
    - To help clinicians, students, and researchers explore patterns efficiently

=> Tools & Technologies Used:

    1) Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)
    2) Power BI (for dashboarding)
    3) Jupyter Notebook / Colab
    4) GitHub for version control
